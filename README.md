# Tecton Sample Repository

This is a sample Tecton feature repository. It showcases various different feature types for both a fictional fraud-detection and an ads-serving ML use case. It can be used with any Tecton demo cluster.

Please see [Tecton's documentation](https://docs.tecton.ai/) for more information on how to use Tecton, and how to create new features.
